## BEAST2

### Which version of BEAUti do you use as a guideline?

Version 2.5.1, as can be found in the [install_beast2](https://github.com/ropensci/beastier/blob/master/R/install_beast2.R) function.

### How to install BEAST2?

```
beastier::install_beast2()
```

### How to install the BEAST2 NS package?

## `babette` development 

### What's the road map?

Currently, `babette` does not have a road map itself, but `beautier` does:

## `babette` technical questions

### Which operating systems are supported?

 * Linux: Lubuntu, for unencrypted home folders
 * macOS
 * Windows

Other Linux distros may work, [CentOS does not work](https://github.com/ropensci/babette/issues/31).

### How can I inspect a generated BEAST2 XML file?

Set a path to a desired location and disable cleaning up:

```
out <- bbt_run(
  fasta_filename = get_babette_path("anthus_aco_sub.fas"),
  beast2_input_filename = "/home/ropensci/beast2.xml",
  cleanup = FALSE
)
```

The XML file will be saved at that location.

### If I set a fixed crown age with multiple alignments, only the first alignment has so

Correct. This is a feature of BEAST2. Using the `create_mrca` prior 
gives prettier results.

### How can I estimate the marginal likelihood?

To estimate the marginal likelihood, create a Nested Sampling MCMC object:

```r
testit::assert(beastier::is_beast2_installed())
testit::assert(mauricer::is_beast2_pkg_installed("NS"))
out <- bbt_run(
  fasta_filename = get_babette_path("anthus_aco.fas"),
  mcmc = create_mcmc_nested_sampling(),
  beast2_path = get_default_beast2_bin_path()
)
```

 * Van Els, Paul, and Heraldo V. Norambuena. "A revision of species limits in Neotropical pipits Anthus based on multilocus genetic and vocal data." Ibis.

Thanks to Paul van Els.

## `babette` misc

### Why the name?

 * `ba`: BeAutier
 * `bet`: BEasTier
 * `te`: TracErer

Later on, `mauricer` got added.

### Why the logo?

Initially, the logo was a low-tech remake of Babette, a maid in Beauty and the Beast. 
To prevent problems with Disney, a different logo was picked.

The current logo shows a swan, an animal considered to be graceful.
The swan is drawn by Jose Scholte, who kindly allowed her work to
be used for free, by attribution.

### How to create the dependency graph from the `.dot` file?

```
dot -Tps dependencies.dot -o dependencies.ps
convert dependencies.ps dependencies.png
```
